# COP3330-Final-Project
Final project UCF COP3330

Main.java is the app code that handles a student "P.O.S". 
The user enters a list of courses (including details) and labs associated with courses through lec.txt
then the program will walk you through adding Professors, TA's and Students to the courses.
You also have the option of adding/removing courses from the list.
At the end of the code, there will be an output lec1.txt that will print out the most recent verison of courses available.

This was written in conjuction with my class mates Jaden and Ian.
